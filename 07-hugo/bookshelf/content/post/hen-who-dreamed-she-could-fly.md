In February 2016, I read **The Hen Who Dreamed She Could Fly**. This short book is an amazing  and inspiring story of a hen Sprout who wanted to live a normal happy life outside of a coop. The lesson I learnt from this book is that you have to break shackles and work towards a life that you want to live. If you believe in your dreams and donâ€™t give up then you will live a life worth living.
