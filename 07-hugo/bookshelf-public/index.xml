          <description>&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;strong&gt;Good to Great in January 2016&lt;/strong&gt;. An awesome read sharing detailed analysis on how good companies became great. Although this book is about how companies became great but we could apply a lot of the learnings on ourselves. Concepts like level 5 leader, hedgehog concept, the stockdale paradox are equally applicable to individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;In February 2016, I read &lt;strong&gt;The Hen Who Dreamed She Could Fly&lt;/strong&gt;. This short book is an amazing  and inspiring story of a hen Sprout who wanted to live a normal happy life outside of a coop. The lesson I learnt from this book is that you have to break shackles and work towards a life that you want to live. If you believe in your dreams and donâ€™t give up then you will live a life worth living.&lt;/p&gt;
