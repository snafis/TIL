Today I Learned
--------

I have taken a challenge to learn a new technology every week in 2016. The goal is to learn a new technology, build a simple application using it, and blog about it.

## Technologies covered in 52 technologies in 2016 series

Below is the list of technologies covered in this series:

1. **[Week 1: January 03, 2016](https://github.com/snafis/TIL/tree/master/01-finatra)** [Finatra - Build Beautiful REST API The Twitter Way](https://github.com/snafis/TIL/tree/master/01-finatra/README.md).

This week I had to give a talk on Docker ecosystem so I spent a lot of my after office hours preparing for the talk. [Docker](http://docker.com/) is a container technology that allows us to package an application and its dependencies together in a filesystem so that they can be deployed together on any server. This helps us achieve package once deploy anywhere. So, in the next few posts of this series, we will learn how Java developers can get started with Docker.

The use case was that after user registers with the application, we will create a cron job that will track his/her social activities. We will have one container per user. I wanted to keep cron jobs to work in a different process from the main application so that different concerns of the application don't intermingle. In my view, containers provide the right abstraction to solve this use case.

41. **[Week 41: December 04, 2016](https://github.com/snafis/TIL/tree/master/41-akka-dispatcher)** [Understanding Akka Dispatcher](https://github.com/snafis/TIL/blob/master/41-akka-dispatcher/README.md):  [Akka](http://akka.io/) is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed and resilient message driven systems. This post assumes you already know Akka. Actor needs a dispatcher to perform its task. A dispatcher relies on executor to provide thread. There are two types of executors a dispatcher can have: 1) `fork-join-executor` 2) `thread-pool-executor`. In this post, we will understand how you can configure `fork-join-executor` and `thread-pool-executor` to meet your needs.

43. **[Week 43: December 26, 2016](https://github.com/snafis/TIL/tree/master/43-graphql)** [GraphQL - building a pokedex in React with GraphQL](https://github.com/snafis/TIL/blob/master/43-graphql/README.md): [GraphQL](http://graphql.org), a query language that is starting to get more and more attention. Facebook, who internally used GraphQL since 2012 and released a first specification and reference implementation of GraphQL in 2015 announced GraphQL to be [production ready] in September 2016. What followed is a trend of more and more companies starting to use GraphQL, such as GitHub, Coursera and Shopify.
